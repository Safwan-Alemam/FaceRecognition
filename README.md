# Face Recognition with OpenCV

A simple real-time face detection app using OpenCV in Python with mirror (selfie) effect.

## Features

- **Real-time face detection** from your webcam.
- **Mirror flip**: Camera acts like a selfie, so left/right movement is natural.
- **Easy to run** for beginners and students.

## Files

- `face_recognition.py` — Main Python script for face detection.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` — The face detection classifier from OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- opencv-python

## Installation

1. **Install requirements**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

2. **Download/Open the repository and make sure these two files are in the same folder:**
    - `face_recognition.py`
    - `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`

## Usage

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python face_recognition.py
    ```
3. A camera window will appear. Face detection should work instantly.
4. Press **q** to quit.
